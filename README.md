# Routing
Network Routing Implementation using Maximum bandwidth path algorithms
As part of graduate course project for Analysis of Algorithms, following algorithms were implemented in this project to solve the 
MAX-BANDWIDTH-PATH problem:

1) Modified Dijkstra's without using heap structure.
2) Modified Dijkstra's using a heap structure.
3) Modified Kruskal's where edges are sorted by Heap sort.

All the algorithms were tested on both sparse and dense networks. Their performace was cross verified by known theoretical 
complexity. It was observed that Modified Dijkstra's algorithm using a heap structure performed the best in both the sparse 
and dense networks as theory suggests.

Implementation details are described in the project report. And the instructions to run have been given in the README.txt file
inside the project folder.
